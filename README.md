## üìö Course Overview

This material explores the fundamental concepts of **Hardware Descriptive Languages (HDL)** and **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)**. The primary goal was to gain working knowledge of **Verilog HDL** and its application in implementing various digital system designs.

## üß™ Laboratory Work

The labs were instrumental in building a foundation in Verilog modeling and introducing practical implementation on an FPGA kit.

### Lab Objectives
These labs were designed to:
* Provide the concepts and fundamentals of **HDL** and **FPGA** technology.
* Gain working proficiency in **Verilog** for system design.
* Implement and simulate various digital circuits using the **Xilinx ISE Design Suite**.
* Introduce the practical implementation of digital systems on a physical **FPGA Kit**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment & Tools

* **HDL:** **Verilog**
* **Design Suite:** **Xilinx ISE Design Suite**
* **Target Hardware:** **Spartan-3E FPGA Kit**
